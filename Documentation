## ✅ Step 5: Set Up Your Jekyll Site (Configuring for Your Quiz App)
We will begin by configuring your Jekyll site and making it ready to host your quiz app. Here are the detailed steps:

## ✅ Step 5.1: Open Your Jekyll Site in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Open VSCode: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

## ✅ Open Your Project Folder:

## ✅ In VSCode, click File → Open Folder.
## ✅ Navigate to the folder where your Jekyll site is located (e.g., Quiz-app) and select it. This will open the entire folder in VSCode.
----- If you have already created a Jekyll site using jekyll new (as you did before), it will contain the default folder structure.

## ✅ Step 5.2: Find the _config.yml File
## ✅ Locate _config.yml in the Project Folder: In the file explorer (on the left sidebar of VSCode), you will see a list of folders and files. Find and click on the _config.yml file. This file is located in the root of your project folder (same level as your index.md, about.md, etc.).

## ✅ The _config.yml file is where you will set key information about your site, like its title, description, and URL.

## ✅ Step 5.3: Edit the _config.yml File
## ✅ Now, let’s edit the _config.yml file to configure the basic settings for your quiz app.

## ✅ Open the _config.yml File:

## ✅ Click on the _config.yml file to open it in the editor window.
## ✅ Modify the File with the Following Settings:

You will see several key-value pairs in the file. Replace or add the following lines to customize your site for the quiz app:

yaml

# Basic Configuration Settings
title: "My Quiz App"  # Name of your site. This will appear in the browser tab.
description: "A simple, interactive quiz app to test your knowledge."  # A short description for your site.

# This is the base URL for your site. Leave it empty if you're hosting directly under your GitHub username.
baseurl: ""  # You can leave this empty unless you plan to use a subfolder.

# The URL for your site. If you are using GitHub Pages, use your GitHub Pages URL.
url: "https://your-username.github.io"  # Replace with your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain if you have one.

# Optional: Set the theme for your site (if you want a simple, clean design, you can use the default theme).
theme: "jekyll-theme-slate"  # This is the default theme. You can change it to a different theme if you want.

# Set the repository URL (useful for links in the site’s footer or for adding social media sharing buttons).
repository: "https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app"  # Replace with the actual GitHub repository URL for your site.

# Optional: Set up navigation links to your pages or quizzes (you can add more links later).
navigation:
  - title: "Home"
    url: "/"
  - title: "Quiz 1"
    url: "/quizzes/quiz1"
  - title: "About"
    url: "/about"
Explanation of Each Field:

title: The name of your site (what will appear in the browser tab).
description: A brief description of your quiz app.
baseurl: If your site is hosted in a subfolder (e.g., github.com/your-username/quiz-app), you would set this to "/quiz-app", but for a default GitHub Pages site, leave it empty.
url: The main URL for your site. If you’re using GitHub Pages, it will be in the format https://your-username.github.io/repository-name. If you’ve set up a custom domain, use that domain instead.
theme: You can leave this as jekyll-theme-slate or use another theme. Themes define the look of your site, and there are many free Jekyll themes you can use.
repository: The URL to your GitHub repository. This is helpful for linking back to your repo in the footer or navigation.
navigation: This is the navigation menu where you define the links to your pages, like "Home," "Quiz 1," "About," etc.
